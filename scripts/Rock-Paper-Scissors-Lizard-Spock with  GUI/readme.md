# **Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock With GUI**

The game will be an unique variation to the traditional *Rock-paper-scissors* game. Rather this game will have two other moves i.e. *Lizard* and *Spock* added with *Rock* , *Paper* And *Scissors*. Each Of Player will take turns to play against the computer and their highest score before they lose three times will be taken into account. 

A GUI (Graphical User Interface) Application is made  using tkinter. This application will have 3 windows. 

### **Window 1** 

This will be the starting window of the game where the player will enter his name. And hit **START!**
When the player hits start buttons this window will close And the game window i.e window 2 will open .

### **Window 2**

Here in this window 5 buttons each 
for rock, paper, scissors, lizard and spock.. 
Images for each is added. For 
each round first the player selects an 
action by clicking on any one of the rock, 
paper, scissors, lizard or spark button, after 
that the computer will randomly select an 
action and both will be evaluated. The 
winner gets a point and the game ends 
when the player loses three times. After some seconds this window will close and window 3 will display.

### **Window 3**

In This Window it will show the player score
and the player  will have a button whether to start a new game or exit. On clicking start a new 
game, window 3 will close and window 
1 will open and exit will close all window 
and program stops. 

But wait , it's not a game on paper it's a game on computer !!

Points on which The Evaluation Is Made :-
- Scissors cuts Paper 
- Paper covers Rock 
- Rock crushes Lizard 
- Lizard poisons Spock 
- Spock smashes Scissors 
- Scissors decapitates Lizard 
- Lizard eats Paper 
- Paper disproves Spock
